### Assignment 11 - Workshop Things I learned at the workshop
- I first learned about data exporting into the https://ce.ezanalytix.com/ platform, which has a very simple drag and drop option that is both convenient and time saving.
- This tool has built-in functions for data analysis, and there is no need for coding for data analysis, so anyone with no coding knowledge can analyze the data by following a few simple steps.
- With this tool, data stratification can be done quickly and easily.
- This tool includes data processing steps such as data joining, record modification, variable modification, and validation rules.
