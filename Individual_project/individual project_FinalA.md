# Introduction 
## why Economy & Growth Topic 
- Higher economic growth results in higher tax revenues, allowing the government to spend more on public services such as health care and education, among other things. Higher living standards, such as increased life expectancy, higher literacy rates, and a better understanding of civic and political issues, can be achieved as a result.
## Why these Indicators
- A healthy economy is one in which both exports and imports are increasing. This usually indicates economic strength and a long-term trade surplus or deficit. If exports are increasing while imports are declining, it may indicate that foreign economies are doing better than the domestic economy. If, on the other hand, exports fall sharply while imports rise, it may indicate that the domestic economy is doing better than overseas markets.
- Economic growth is defined as an increase in an economy's aggregate production. Increasing capital in the economy tends to increase labor productivity. Workers can produce more output per time period when they have access to newer, better, and more tools.
## Goods exports (BoP, current US$)
- When a country exports goods, it sells them to a foreign market, which includes consumers, businesses, and governments in other countries. These exports bring money into the country, increasing the GDP of the exporting country.

- The United States has the highest percentage of good exports in 2018, at 68 percent, while India has the lowest, at 11.9 percent.as a result, United States The gpd profit from export is reasonable.
- India, because it is densely populated, can make much better profits from exports; however, it has a low GDP value.

## Imports of goods and services (BoP, current US$)
- When a country imports goods, it represents a capital outflow from that country. Local businesses are importers, and they make payments to foreign entities, or exporters. Imports at a high level indicate strong domestic demand and a growing economy.

- Between 2010 and 2020, the United States' imports of goods and services fluctuated significantly. As a result, this could be a deciding factor in determining the economy. 
- Growth in India and the United Kingdom has been consistent over the years, with little variation in the import of goods and services. As a result, they make little difference.

##  Trade in services (% of GDP)
- The sale and delivery of an intangible product known as a Trade in service between a producer and a consumer is referred to as trade in services. International Trade in Services refers to the exchange of services between a producer and a consumer who are legally located in different countries.

-  With respect to Trade in services the United Kingdom ranks No 1Â with 19.34 percent of the market, followed by India with 11.69 percent and the United States with 6.79 percent. 
## Conclusion
- I believe that trade in services and trade in goods exports would provide us with two distinct perspectives on the economy and growth. Imports of goods and services into the United States have fluctuated over time. It is, however, consistent for India and the United Kingdom.
